# Introduction {-}
This is a figures only version of a set of GSL water quality and nutrient analyses. All data are drawn from USGS NWIS or EPA WQP.  
For details and code see: [bookdown.org/jakevl/gsl-nutrients](https://bookdown.org/jakevl/gsl-nutrients){target="_blank"}  

This project remains in active development and does not represent any official agency position.  

The first section, 'Basic analyses & figures', provides a set of contextual figures meant to characterize spatial and temporal variability of important water quality, 
lake elevation, and tributary discharge parameters.  

The second section, 'Nutrient pools & loads', documents the methods and results for estimating nutrient pools in and loads to Gilbert Bay.
